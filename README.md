# dotfiles
That's my (edufcarvalho) dotfiles, I created them to be simple and functional for my personal usage. That dotfiles are not agnostic or flexible in any way, everything is build to MY *and probably only my* usage.

That dotfiles are tweaked with some uncommon things, but I found this things usefull, then, here they are.

If you're searching for a well developed, well maintained and flexible dotfiles, you came to the wrong place. I recomend the [holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), check it out in the link.
